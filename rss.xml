&lt;p&gt;You know “things” like life, kids, career and all the other stuff.&lt;br&gt;
Well I am happy to say that I set aside some time to get this super fast static site up!
I will make a post about what is under the hood soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on posting a blend or tech, jeeps, travel and life in general.
I don’t want to say how often I will post, but I will be posting often.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

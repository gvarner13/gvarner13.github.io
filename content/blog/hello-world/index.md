I have been trying to setup my own site for years and I kept letting things get in the way. 
You know “things” like life, kids, career and all the other stuff.  
Well I am happy to say that I set aside some time to get this super fast static site up! 
I will make a post about what is under the hood soon.

I plan on posting a blend or tech, jeeps, travel and life in general. 
I don’t want to say how often I will post, but I will be posting often.
